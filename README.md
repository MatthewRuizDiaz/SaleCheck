This project is a way to track sale prices on amazon with an aggregated list through a chrome extension. It was something that I've wanted for a while because I will save 5-10 amazon links in a bookmarks folder and if I want to know if they are on sale, I have to navigate to each page. So I had the idea to combine them all into one list, with the most updated sale price dynamically updating next to the name of the product. This is a project that will only work for amazon products in the US. The full version will be much more expansive.
